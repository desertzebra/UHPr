# UHPr
The lack of Interoperable healthcare data presents a major challenge, towards achieving ubiquitous health care. The plethora of diverse medical standards, rather than common standards, is widening the gap of interoperability.While many organizations are working towards a standardized solution, there is a need for an alternate strategy, which can intelligently mediate amongst a variety of medical systems, not complying with any mainstream healthcare standards while utilizing the benefits of several standard merging initiates, to eventually create digital health personas. 
The existence and efficiency of such a platform is dependent upon the underlying storage and processing engine, which can acquire, manage and retrieve the relevant medical data. Ubiquitous Health Profile (UHPr) is a multi-dimensional data curation platform which was created with medical data interoperability in mind. Here you will find the supplementary material and code for UHPr. 
This platform is part of the Intelligent Medical Platform (IMP), with details available at http://imprc.cafe24.com/
